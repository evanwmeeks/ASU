This folder is a compliation of coursework from Arizona State University's "CSE 205 - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures". The first 3 chapters are purposefully omitted, as they were review work from CSE 110. 

Only Challenge Activities are represented within these documents, with all Participation Activities having been ommitted. Even still, Challenge Activities that were multi-level were left out as well as they were difficult to capture yet provided little educational value.
